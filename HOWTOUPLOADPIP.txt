pip install QhX-new-dynamical==0.1.1

1. Update the Version Number in pyproject.toml:
Make sure the version number is incremented. You've already updated it to 0.1.1, but double-check that it is correctly set:

toml
Copy code
[project]
version = "0.1.1"  # Ensure this is the new version
2. Clean the Previous Build Files:
Before rebuilding the package, remove any previous build artifacts to avoid conflicts:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info
This will remove old build files.

3. Rebuild the Package:
Now rebuild the package with the updated version number:

bash
Copy code
python -m build
4. Upload the New Version:
Once the package is built, upload it to PyPI:

bash
Copy code
python -m twine upload dist/*
