.. note::

   **Note to Users:**
   The examples provided in this documentation (repository) are intended to illustrate the usage of the QhX package and its functionalities. They are designed as general guides to help you understand how to implement the package in various scenarios.

   However, it is important to recognize that:

   - **Parameter selection is context-dependent**: The parameters used in these examples are not optimal for real use cases. They are just toy examples. The selection of parameters (such as `ntau`, `ngrid`, `minfq`, `maxfq`, etc.) should be based on the specific characteristics and requirements of your data and the problem you are addressing.
   - **Expert judgment required**: We encourage users to apply their domain knowledge and expertise in choosing the most appropriate parameters. Experimentation and validation are key to determining the best configuration for your particular scenario.
   - **Dynamic nature of data analysis**: As data analysis is often an iterative and exploratory process, we recommend iteratively adjusting and fine-tuning parameters based on the results and performance metrics relevant to your project.

   We hope these examples serve as a starting point for your exploration of the QhX package. If you have any questions or need further guidance on parameter selection, please feel free to reach out to the LSST SER-SAG team or consult additional resources specific to your domain of application.

Notebook examples and data files
