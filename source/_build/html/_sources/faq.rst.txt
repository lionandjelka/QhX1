Overflow Warning in libwwz.wwz
------------------------------

**Q: What does the warning "/libwwz/wwz.py:234: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in double scalars" mean and how can I resolve it?**

A: This warning message indicates that a mathematical operation in the `libwwz.wwz` module resulted in a number too large for a Python floating-point scalar to represent. This often occurs in operations like division where the denominator is a very small number close to zero.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing and Validation**: Ensure that your input data is correctly preprocessed and within expected ranges to prevent such numerical issues.

2. **Adjust Algorithm Parameters**: Tweaking parameters controlling the computation can sometimes prevent the occurrence of extreme values.

3. **Alternative Mathematical Approaches**: Consider using a different computational method or algorithm that is more robust to extreme values if adjustments do not resolve the issue.

4. **Handling the Warning**: If the warning does not critically impact your application and the results are still valid, you may suppress or catch the warning using Python's `warnings` module, but exercise caution.

5. **Check Computational Environment**: Ensure that your Python environment and dependencies are correctly set up and updated. For example in google colaboratory these warnings are not encountered.
